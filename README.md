### Optimizing Food Recycling

- Description: Everyday, tonnes of food in urban cities is thrown away because they could not be consumed before expiry. Food wastage not only has a big impact on the environment, but also could have been better used to feed communities in need.

Solution Needed: Create a platform that connects food suppliers (restaurants, grocery stores, catering services) with local food banks and non-profit organisations. The platform should use data analytics to optimise food rescue routes, minimize transportation costs, and maximize benefits to communities in need. Instead of throwing away food that is close to expiry, or has been cooked but not consumed, can we organise rescue efforts for these food items so that they can be redistributed to those in need? Collection and redistribution logistics are key, and the app should optimise timing and route transport so as to minimize transport costs while ensuring food does not sit around and spoil while waiting to be re-distributed to those in need. Transport distances also cannot be too far for the same reasons.
