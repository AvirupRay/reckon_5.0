# RobinFood

RobinFood is a web platform that bridges the gap between restaurants with surplus food and non-governmental organization (NGOs),food banks, dedicated to distributing food to those in need. This project aims to reduce food waste by facilitating the efficient and timely donation of excess food from restaurants to organizations that can redirect it to individuals facing food insecurity.


## Features

1. Supplier Registration
Suppliers can register on RobinFood, providing details about their location, operating hours, and the type of surplus food they generate.

2. Collector Registration
Collectors can sign up on the platform, specifying their location, target population, and operational capacity.

3. Food Donation Listings
Suppliers can create listings for available surplus food, detailing the type, quantity, and expiration date. Collectors can browse these listings and request donations that match their requirements.

4. Real-time Communication
A messaging system allows seamless communication between Suppliers and Collectors to coordinate the logistics of food donations. (Work in progress)

5. Dashboard Analytics
Both suppliers and collectors have access to a dashboard displaying statistics on their contributions and impact, fostering transparency and accountability. (Work in progress)
